# Configuration for the usb_modeswitch package, a mode switching tool for
# USB devices providing multiple states or modes
#
# Evaluated by the wrapper script /usr/bin/usb_modeswitch_dispatcher
#
# To enable an option, set it to "1", "yes" or "true" (case doesn't matter)
# Everything else counts as "disable"


# Disable automatic mode switching globally (e.g. to access the original
# install storage)

DisableSwitching=0


# Enable logging (results in a extensive report file in /var/log, named
# "usb_modeswitch_<interface-name>" and probably others

# Optional increase of "delay_use" for the usb-storage driver; there are hints
# that a recent kernel default change to 1 sec. may lead to problems, particu-
# larly with USB 3.0 ports. Set this to at least 3 (seconds) in that case.
# Does nothing if the current system value is same or higher
